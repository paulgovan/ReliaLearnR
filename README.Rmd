Welcome to **ReliaLearnR!** This package provides interactive learning
modules for beginners in reliability analysis. The modules are built
using the `learnr` package and cover topics such as life data analysis,
reliability testing, and reliability, availability, and maintainability
(RAM) concepts. The package also includes helper functions for common
RAM calculations. 

## Installation

To install ReliaLearnR in R:

``` r
install.packages('ReliaLearnR')
```

To install the development version:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("paulgovan/ReliaLearnR")
```

Note: You may be prompted to update dependent packages before installing. 
To do this when prompted during installation type 1 (All) to update.

## Usage

The package includes three interactive learning modules. To access
them, load the package and call the respective function:

-   `lda()` - An introduction to Life Data
    Analysis (estimated duration \~2 hours)
-   `ram()` - A quick reference for common Reliability,
    Availability, and Maintainability concepts (estimated duration \~ 1
    hour)
-   `rt()`- An interactive introduction to Reliability Testing
    (estimated duration \~ 2 hours)

The modules can also be accessed in a browser at
[https://paulgovan.shinyapps.io/RAMAnalysis/](https://paulgovan.shinyapps.io/RAMAnalysis/),
[https://paulgovan.shinyapps.io/LifeDataAnalysis/](https://paulgovan.shinyapps.io/LifeDataAnalysis/) and
[https://paulgovan.shinyapps.io/ReliabilityTesting/](https://paulgovan.shinyapps.io/ReliabilityTesting/).

Several helper functions for common RAM calculations are also included. These
functions can be used independently of the learning modules:

-   `rel()` - reliability function
-   `avail()` - availability function
-   `mttf()` - mean time to failure
-   `mtbf()` - mean time between failure
-   `fr()` - failure rate
