Welcome to **ReliaLearnR!** This package provides interactive learning
modules for beginners in reliability analysis. The modules are built
using the `learnr` package and cover topics such as life data analysis,
reliability testing, and reliability, availability, and maintainability
(RAM) concepts. The package also includes helper functions for common
RAM calculations. 

## Installation

To install ReliaLearnR in R:

``` r
install.packages('ReliaLearnR')
```

To install the development version:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("paulgovan/ReliaLearnR")
```

Note: You may be prompted to update dependent packages before installing. 
To do this when prompted during installation type 1 (All) to update.

## Prerequisites

These modules are designed for engineering students and professionals interested
in learning the fundamentals of reliability analysis. They assume a basic understanding
of R and statistics. For a complete beginners' guide to R, check out the resources at
[https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/).

## Usage

The package includes three interactive learning modules. To access
them, load the package and call the respective function:

-   `ram()` - A quick reference for common Reliability,
    Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) concepts 
-   `lda()` - An introduction to Life Data
    Analysis
-   `rt()`- An introduction to Reliability Testing

The modules can also be accessed in a browser at
[paulgovan.shinyapps.io/RAMAnalysis/](https://paulgovan.shinyapps.io/RAMAnalysis/),
[paulgovan.shinyapps.io/LifeDataAnalysis/](https://paulgovan.shinyapps.io/LifeDataAnalysis/) and
[paulgovan.shinyapps.io/ReliabilityTesting/](https://paulgovan.shinyapps.io/ReliabilityTesting/).

Several helper functions for common RAM calculations are also included. These
functions can be used independently of the learning modules:

-   `rel()` - reliability function
-   `avail()` - availability function
-   `mttf()` - mean time to failure
-   `mtbf()` - mean time between failure
-   `fr()` - failure rate

## Motivation

This project is based on a reliability program at a major technology company. The
original program helped many early-career professionals learn the fundamentals
of reliability engineering. However, the program was proprietary, limiting accessibility
and leading to outdated learning materials as software evolved. By providing an open-source 
alternative, this project aims to reach a broader audience and foster a community 
of collaboration.
