# ReliaLearnR 0.3 (Formerly WeibullR.learnr)

## Breaking Changes
* The package has been renamed from `WeibullR.learnr` to `ReliaLearnR` to better 
reflect its broader focus on reliability engineering topics beyond just Weibull analysis.
* All functions and tutorials have been updated to use the new package name `ReliaLearnR`.
* The `WeibullR.learnr()` function has been renamed to `lda()` to simplify its usage. 
* The `TestR.learnr()` function has been renamed to `rt()` to simplify its usage.
* The `RAMR.learnr()` function has been renamed to `ram()` to simplify its usage.
* All references to `WeibullR.learnr` in documentation and vignettes have been updated to `ReliaLearnR`.

## Other Improvements
* Better (and more) examples and exercises in all tutorials. Improved comments and explanations.
