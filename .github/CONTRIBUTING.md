# Contributing to ReliaLearnR

This guide outlines how to propose a change to ReliaLearnR.

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. 
This generally means you'll need to edit [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) in an `.Rmd`, not an `.html` file. 
You can find the `.Rmd` files for the tutorials in the '/inst/tutorials/<tutorial acronym>' sub directories. For example, the sub directory 
for the life data analysis tutorial is located at '/inst/tutorials/lda/'.

## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed. 
If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal example.

## New tutorials

This project is being actively developed, and recommendations for new tutorials are always welcome. While the aim is to cover a broad range of reliability topics,
the focus is primarily on data-based reliability analysis methods. Some ideas for possible future tutorials include:

* Repairable Systems Analysis
* Parametric Survival Analysis
* Reliability Block Diagrams

To propose a new tutorial, or if you would like to contribute your own tutorial, please open an issue to discuss further. 

### Pull request process

*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github("paulgovan/ReliaLearnR", fork = TRUE)`.

*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. 
    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. 
*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init("brief-description-of-change")`.

*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.
    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.
    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.

*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header).
